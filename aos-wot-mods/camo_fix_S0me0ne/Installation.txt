Asked to make a mod that would Fix bug with camouflage - and indeed sometimes is not good when you come into the game - always default winter camouflage .
My mod solves this problem - you can make a random selection of camouflage every time you change the tank in the hangar , or choose one type of camouflage forever , and in the hangar so it will always ask how .
In fashion there is a file camo.cfg, which is located on the way / res_mods/0.8.9/camo.cfg
There you can set the parameters :
camo:
- Winter: winter camouflage constantly
- Summer: summer constantly camouflage
- Desert: desert camouflage constantly
userandom:
- Yes: constantly casual camouflage hangar ignored field camo
- No: off the random camouflage in the hangar , the value is taken from the camo

Last Update:
- Added GUI settings in the hangar
- Random Camouflage works by changing the tank in the hangar , and not once in the entire session
- Some more minor fixes
- Adaptation to 0.8.10
