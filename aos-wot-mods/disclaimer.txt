The only thing I've done is to create my own XVM configuration, 6th sense icon, remove a lot of XVM default crap, and wrap an installer around the whole thing to make it easier for others to install the mods.

This installer is not meant for the general public - its just for my friends and such - so please don't redistribute it!

The changes made to the XVM configuration is:
* Enabled latency (ping) tests.
* Hiding tutorial.
* Reformatted player lists to put emphasis on players' WN6 rather than EFF. (EFF is so 2012).
* Enabled hit log
* Enabled win chance
* Redefined colors such as WR, WN & EFF so that the color codes are based on the thresholds from WotLabs, and WOT-News respectively.
* When you press ALT you see the name of the player in the color of the players WN6 rating.
* Platoon mates damage to enemies is colored yellow, and when they receive damage it's colored magenta (because real men don't say 'pink').
* Minimap shows a red line with dots where the camera points to.
* Minimap shows a circle around the tank to indicate proxy spotting range.
* SixSense icon is the AoS logo *** VERY IMPORTANT ***
* Preconfigured contour icons to use two different directories (under res_mods\xvm\res\contours\ you have ally, and enemy)

The installer will also add a link to ADU to your Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder.

NB. If the installer complains that its not able to overwrite C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\ActiveDossierUploader.exe, then just close ADU in your task bar (its the icon with the green circle next to the clock), and click on "Try Again".

I've made a google project to share the sources for this mod pack installer with whom it might interest.
