This is locastans enhanced Minimap mod.

It replaces the minimap with high resolution images taken from the real game, adds new icons for top/high tier tanks and allows to increase the minimap size to full screen.
Functionality extensions include the display of enlarged centered minimap by holding CTRL button, as well as the display of tanknames next to the icons on the map and custom sized minimap icons.
I also added a customizeable distance circle tha can display your tanks viewrange, range circle for artillery, map square legend for non 1000m sized maps, engine dynamic object drawbox and laser and hull direction lines.
 
All these elements can be configured in Mmap.xml residing in res_mods.

In res_mods you find a configuration file named Mmap.xml for these features.

You find details about the configuration file inside the comments of Mmap.xml

Other customization Options:

- If you want to have the normal ingame minimaps instead of the HD ones, just delete the spaces folder from this mod.
