Title: AoS' mod pack installer - 0.9.0.1
Text:
I've created a installer using NSIS of my mod packs for all those that can't be bothered with downloading mods, and installing them manually from the ZIP files.

[size=150]-> [url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11915528/wot/aos-wot-mods-0.9.0.1.exe]aos-wot-mods-0.9.0.1.exe[/url][/size]

Here's a zip file for those that don't like an installer.

Its kinda fun, and easy to use NSIS, so if anyone wants some advise, then I'll be happy to help.

Here's some details of my mod pack:

The changes made to the XVM configuration are:
[list]
[*]Enabled latency (ping) tests.
[*]Hiding tutorial.
[*]Reformatted player lists to put emphasis on players' WN8 rather than EFF. (EFF is so 2012).
[*]Enabled hit log
[*]Enabled win chance
[*]Redefined colors such as WR, WN & EFF so that the color codes are based on the thresholds from WotLabs, and WOT-News respectively.
[*]When you press ALT you see the name of the player in the color of the players WN8 rating.
[*]Platoon mates damage to enemies is colored yellow, and when they receive damage it's colored magenta (because real men don't say 'pink'!).
[*]Minimap shows a red line with dots where the camera points to.
[*]Minimap shows a circle around the tank to indicate proxy spotting range.
[*]SixSense icon is the AoS logo - [b]*** VERY IMPORTANT ***[/b]
[*]Preconfigured contour icons to use two different directories (under res_mods\xvm\res\contours\ you have ally, and enemy)
[/list]

Currently minimap doesn't draw any lines. Its properly because its still a test version of XVM.

The changes made to Color Messages and Session Stats are:
[list]
[*]WR, WN6, and WN8 colors are based on WotLabs.net thresholds
[/list]

The installer will also add a link to ADU to your Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder.

[size=150][b]NB. If the installer complains that its not able to overwrite [i]C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\ActiveDossierUploader.exe[/i], then just close ADU in your task bar (its the icon with the green circle next to the clock), and click on "Try Again".[/b][/size]
